Data Spark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics
Project Overview
Data Spark is a comprehensive data exploration project designed to uncover insights from global electronics sales data. The objective is to provide businesses with valuable insights that aid decision-making by analyzing customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and store operations. This project utilizes Python for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), MySQL for managing the cleaned data, and Power BI for generating interactive dashboards to visualize key insights.

Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Utilized Python (Pandas) to clean and merge datasets (customers, products, sales, stores, exchange rates).
SQL Queries for Insights: Developed SQL queries for detailed analysis, focusing on customer behavior, product sales, and store performance.
Interactive Dashboards: Created insightful Power BI dashboards to visualize trends in sales, top-performing stores, and customer demographics.
Data Analysis: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights from the data before visualization.
Tech Stack
Python: Data preprocessing and analysis using Pandas and NumPy.
MySQL: Database management for storing and querying cleaned data.
Power BI: Interactive dashboards for data visualization and insights.
Jupyter Notebook: For running exploratory data analysis.
CSV Files: Raw data used for analysis.
Data Sources
The project uses several datasets in CSV format:

cleaned_customer_df.csv - Customer details
cleaned_products_df.csv - Product information
cleaned_sales_df.csv - Sales data
cleaned_stores_df.csv - Store information
cleaned_exchange_rates_df.csv - Currency exchange rates
These datasets were cleaned, merged, and stored in a MySQL database for further analysis.

Power BI Insights
The Power BI dashboard provides several key insights, such as:

Top Performing Stores: Stores with the highest sales and revenue.
Best Selling Products: Products that contributed the most to overall sales.
Customer Demographics: Distribution of customers by age group and region.
Sales Trends: Visual representation of sales performance over time, highlighting peak sales periods.
